# What's new in version 0.4 ?
- script settings by json file
- possible preload images and prefetch video

# Use

Polyfill is in single javascript module file `youtubeWidgetic.mjs`. Include it into your site like this:

``` html
<div id="youtube-canvas" hidden></div>
<script type="text/json" id="youtube-widgetic-settings">
	{
		"youtubeApiKey": "AIzaSyDUXfwNP4_0kmG8aMLNlY7elAdRQZTFvBA",
		"channelId": "UCwroqcUF4nkMIKh-G9Vc-Eg",
		"modulesImportPath": "/modules",
		"preloadImages": [ "/images/youtube.svg" ],
		"texts": {
			"timePublished": "video published",
			"watchOnYoutube": "Watch on Youtube"
		}
	}
</script>
<script type="module" src="/youtubeWidgetic.mjs?v0.4" crossorigin="anonymous" integrity="sha256-XPGiNIYV9I1Mavs+kT3WFQNyk1pqYVdOBtSnPekOccQ="></script>
```

All other files like `example-usage.html` and `youtube-widgetic.css` are there to help, but they are not needed for polyfill function.
